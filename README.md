## Introduction

pygame-ce (Pygame Community Edition) is an actively maintained and enhanced version of the popular Pygame library. This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning the capabilities of pygame-ce.

Whether you are a beginner looking to start your pygame-ce journey or an experienced developer seeking inspiration and resources, this repository has something for you.

## Getting Started

To get started with pygame-ce and explore the contents of this repository, follow these steps:

### Installing Python

#### Mac

1. **Homebrew (Recommended):** If you don't have Python installed, it's a good idea to use Homebrew for macOS. Install Homebrew if you haven't already by following the instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).

2. **Install Python:** Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install Python 3:

   ```shell
   brew install python
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:** After installation, run `python3 --version` to ensure Python is correctly installed.

#### Windows

1. **Download Python Installer:** Visit the official Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

2. **Download Python:** Choose the latest stable version for Windows and download the installer.

3. **Run Installer:** Double-click the downloaded installer, and follow the installation wizard's instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

4. **Verify Installation:** Open Command Prompt and run `python --version` to confirm Python is installed. You may also use `py --version`.

#### Linux

1. **Check Python Version:** Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. Open your terminal and check the Python version with:

   ```shell
   python --version
   ```

2. **Install Python:** If Python is not installed or you want to install a specific version, use your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, run:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3
   ```

   On Red Hat/Fedora, use `yum` or `dnf`:

   ```shell
   sudo yum update
   sudo yum install python3
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:** After installation, run `python --version` or `python3 --version` to confirm Python is correctly installed.
